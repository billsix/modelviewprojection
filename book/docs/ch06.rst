Modelspace
^^^^^^^^^^


Normalized-device-coordinates are not a natural system of
numbers for use by humans.  Imagine that the paddles in the previous
chapters exist in real life, and are 2 meters wide and 6 meters tall.
The graphics programmer should be able to use those numbers directly;
they shouldn't have to manually transform the distances into normalized-device-coordinates.

Whatever a convenient numbering system is (i.e. coordinate system) for modeling objects
is called "model-space".  Since a paddle has four corners, which corner should be at
the origin (0,0)?  If you don't already know what you want at the origin, then
none of the corners should be; instead put the center of the object
at the origin (Because by putting the center of the object at the origin,
scaling and rotating the object are trivial, as shown in later chapters).

    Representing a Paddle using Modelspace


Modelspace - the coordinate system (origin plus axes), in which some object's
vertices are defined.


WorldSpace
^^^^^^^^^^

WorldSpace is a top-level space, independent of NDC, that we choose to use.  It is arbitrary.
If you were to model a racetrack for a racing game, the origin of WorldSpace may be the center of that racetrack.
If you were modeling our solar system, the center of the sun could be the origin of "WorldSpace".
I personally would put the center of our flat earth at the origin, but reasonable people
can disagree.

For our demo with paddles, the author arbitrarily defines the WorldSpace to be 20 units wide, 20 units tall, with the origin at the center.

Modelspace to WorldSpace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The author prefers to view transformations as changes to the graph paper,
as compared to view transformations as changes to points.

As such, for placing paddle1, we can view the translation as a change
to the graph paper relative to world space coordinates (only incidentally
bringing the vertices
along with it) and then resetting the graph paper (i.e. both origin and axes)
back to its original position and orientation.
Although we will think of the paddle's vertices as relative to its own space
(i.e. -1 to 1 horizontally, -3 to 3 vertically),
we will not look at the numbers of what they are in world space coordinates,
as doing so

* Will not give us any insight

* Will distract us from thinking clearly about what's happening



* As an example, figure out the world space coordinate of the upper rights
  corner of the paddle after it has been translated, and ask yourself what
  that means and what insight did you gain?



The animation above shows multiple steps, shown now without animation.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Paddle 1's graph paper gets translated -9 units in the x direction, and some
number of units in the y direction, 0 during the first frame, based off of user input.  The origin
is translated, and the graph paper comes with it, onto which you can
plot the vertices.  Notice that the coordinate system labels below the plot and to the left of the plot
is unchanged.  That is world space, which has not changed.

==============  ========================



Now that the transformation has happened, the vertices are all in world space.
You could calculate their values in world space, but that will not give you any insight.  The only numbers
that matter for insight as that the entire graph paper of modelspace, which originally
was the same as world space, has changed, bringing the vertices along with it.

Same goes for Paddle 2's modelspace, relative to its translation, which
are different values.

   Instead, for model-space to world-space transformations,
   it is easier to read the transformations backwards, where the transformations
   aren't relative to the global origin, instead its from the local frame of reference.

   When reading the transformations backwards, I think it is best to think of it
   as moving the axes, and the plotting the data once the axes are in
   their final place.


   Why do the two different views of the transformations matter?  In model-space
   to world-space transformations, especially once rotation and scaling of model-space
   is used, it allows the programmer to forget about most details, just specify
   where new objects are relative to that which you are already drawing.

   With that said, that doesn't mean that reading the transformations front to back
   has no value.  Front to back can useful when dealing with camera-space transformations,
   introduced later.

   This will make more sense once rotation is involved.


Scaling
~~~~~~~

Our paddles are now well outside of NDC, and as such, they would not
be displayed, as they would be *clipped* out.  Their values are outside
of -1.0 to 1.0.  All we will need to do to convert them from
world space to NDC is divide each component, x and y, by 10.

As a demonstration of how scaling works, let's make an
object's width twice as large, and height three times as large. (The author
tried doing the actual scaling of 1/10 in an animated gif, and it looked awful,
therefore a different scaling gif is showed here, but the concept
is the same).

We can expand or shrink the size of an object
by "scale"ing each component of the vertices by some coefficient.

    Worldspace.  Don't concern yourself with what the numbers are.



Our global space is -10 to 10 in both dimensions,
and to get it into NDC, we need to scale by dividing by 10

    \begin{bmatrix}
    {p1}_{x} \\
    {p1}_{y}
    \end{bmatrix}


where x_p1, y_p1  are the modelspace coordinates of the paddle's vertices,
and where p1_center_x_worldspace, p1_center_y_worldspace,
are the offset from the world space's origin to the center of the paddle, i.e. the translation.



.. math::
    \begin{bmatrix}
    x_{w} \\
    y_{w}
    \end{bmatrix}  =

    \end{bmatrix} +
    \begin{bmatrix}
    {p2}_{x} \\
    {p2}_{y}
    \end{bmatrix}


Now, the coordinates for paddle 1 and for paddle 2 are in world
space, and we need the match to take any world space coordinates
and convert them to NDC.
