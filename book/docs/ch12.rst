    Demo 12


Code
^^^^


Make a variable to determine the angle that the square will be rotated.

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/demo12/demo.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: doc-region-begin define square rotation
   :end-before: doc-region-end define square rotation
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:
   :caption: src/demo12/demo.py


When 'q' is pressed, increase the angle.

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/demo12/demo.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: doc-region-begin define handle input
   :end-before: doc-region-end define handle input
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:
   :caption: src/demo12/demo.py

Event Loop
~~~~~~~~~~

In the previous chapter, this was the rendering code for
the square.

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/demo11/demo.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: doc-region-begin draw square
   :end-before: doc-region-end draw square
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:
   :caption: src/demo11/demo.py



Since we just want to add one rotation at the end of the sequence
of transformations from paddle 1 space to square space, just add
a rotate call at the top.



.. literalinclude:: ../../src/demo12/demo.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: doc-region-begin draw square
   :end-before: doc-region-end draw square
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:
   :caption: src/demo12/demo.py


The author is getting really tired of having to look at all the different
transformation functions repeatedly defined for each object being drawn.
