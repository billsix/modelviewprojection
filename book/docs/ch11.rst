Relative Objects - Demo 11
==========================

Purpose
^^^^^^^

Introduce relative objects, by making a small blue square
that is defined relative to the left paddle, but offset
some in the x direction.
When the paddle on the left moves or rotates, the blue square
moves with it, because it is defined relative to it.

How to Execute
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Linux or on MacOS, in a shell, type "python src/demo11/demo.py".
On Windows, in a command prompt, type "python src\\demo11\\demo.py".

Description

Cayley Graph
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the graph below, all we have added is "Square space", relative
to paddle 1 space.

    Demo 11

In the picture below, in 3D space, we see that the square has its
own modelspace (as evidenced by the 3 arrows), and we are going
to define its position and orientation relative to paddle 1.

Code
^^^^
..
   We in looking at the code for the three objects we are drawing
   you might notice that we are duplicating a lot of code, and
   that if we decide to change paddle1's transformations, that
   we would need to change the code in multiple places.
   Later demos will show how to handle this problem more gracefully.

Define the geometry of the square in it's own modelspace.

Draw paddle 1, just as before.

.. literalinclude:: ../src/demo11/demo.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: doc-region-begin 7dab1135450b265814f775c59807f77b44273a4e
   :end-before: doc-region-end 7dab1135450b265814f775c59807f77b44273a4e


As a refresher, the author recommends reading the code from modelspace
to worldspace from the bottom up, and from worldspace to NDC from top down.

* Read from modelspace to world space, bottom up
* Reset the coordinate system
* Read from world space to camera space, knowing that camera transformations
  are implemented as the inverse of placing the camera space in world space.
* Reset the coordinate system
* Read cameraspace to NDC

New part!  Draw the square relative to the first paddle!
Translate the square to the right by 20 units.
We are dealing with a -100 to 100 world space, which
later gets scaled down to NDC.

.. literalinclude:: ../src/demo11/demo.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: doc-region-begin 9a0ba48a086f35a4515bf32b4a856888c178b0e8
   :end-before: doc-region-end 9a0ba48a086f35a4515bf32b4a856888c178b0e8


Towards that, we need to do all of the transformations to the square
that we would to the paddle, and then do any extra transformations
afterwards.

As such, read

* Read paddle1space to world space, from bottom up

If we were to plot the square now, it would be in paddle 1's space.  We don't want
that, we want in to be moved in the X direction some units.  Therefore

* Read modelspace to paddle1space, from bottom up
* Reset the coordinate system.

Now the square's geometry will be in it's own space!

* Read from worldspace to cameraspace, knowing that camera transformations
  are implemented as the inverse of placing the camera space in world space.

* Reset the coordinate system
* Read cameraspace to NDC


Draw paddle 2 just like before.
