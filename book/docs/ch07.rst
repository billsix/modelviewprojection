Rotate the Paddles About their Center
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Besides translate and scale, the third main operation in computer
graphics is to rotate an object.


Rotation Around Origin (0,0)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can rotate an object around (0,0) by rotating
all of the object's vertices around (0,0).

.. figure:: _static/rotate0.gif

    Rotate


In high school math, you will have learned about sin, cos, and tangent.
Typically the angles are described on the unit circle, where a rotation
starts from the positive x axis.

.. figure:: _static/cc0/Stephan_Kulla/Sinus_und_Kosinus_am_Einheitskreis_1.svg

We can expand on this knowledge, allowing
us to rotate a given vertex, wherever it is, around the origin (0,0).  This is done
by separating the x and y value, rotating each component separately,
and then adding the results together.

That might not have been fully clear.  Let me try again.
The vertex (0.5,0.4) can be separated into two vertices, (0.5,0) and (0,0.4).

    :alt: Rotate
    :figclass: align-center

    Rotate


These vertices can be added together to create the original vertex.
But, before we do that, let's rotate each of the vertices.

(0.5,0) is on the x-axis, so rotating it by "angle" degrees, results
in vertex (0.5*cos(angle), 0.5*sin(angle)).  This is high school
geometry, and won't be explained here in detail.

.. figure:: _static/rotate.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Rotate
    :figclass: align-center

    Rotate the x component.

.. figure:: _static/cc0/Stephan_Kulla/Sinus_und_Kosinus_am_Einheitskreis_2.svg
    :align: center
    :alt: Demo 07
    :figclass: align-center




But what may not be obvious, is what happens to the y component?
Turns out, it's easy.  Just rotate your point of view, and it's
the same thing, with one minor difference, in that the x value
is negated.





.. figure:: _static/rotate2.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Rotate
    :figclass: align-center

    Rotate the y component

.. figure:: _static/cc0/Stephan_Kulla/Sinus_und_Kosinus_am_Einheitskreis_3.svg
    :align: center
    :alt: Demo 07
    :figclass: align-center


(0,0.4) is on the y-axis, so rotating it by "angle" degrees, results
in vertex (0.4*-sin(angle), 0.4*cos(angle)).


Wait.  Why is negative sin applied to the angle to make the x value,
and cos applied to angle to make the y value?  It's because positive
1 unit on the x axis goes downwards.  The top of the plot is in
units of -1.


After the rotations have been applied, sum the results to
get your vertex rotated around the origin!

(0.5*cos(angle), 0.5*sin(angle)) + (0.4*-sin(angle), 0.4*cos(angle)) =
(0.5*cos(angle) + 0.4*-sin(angle), 0.5*sin(angle) + 0.4*cos(angle))

So to rotate paddle 1 about its center,
we should translate to its position, and then rotate
around the paddle's center.

Why it's Wrong
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Turns out, our program doesn't work as predicted, even though
translate, scale, and rotate are all defined correctly.  The paddles
are not rotating around their center.

Let's take a look in detail about what our paddle-space to
world space transformations are doing.

So then what the heck are we supposed to do in order to
rotate around an object's center?  The next section
provides a solution.



Updated explanation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can expand on this knowledge, allowing
us to rotate all vertices, wherever they are, around the origin (0,0), by some
angle theta.

Let's take any arbitrary point

.. math::


    \vec{a}

.. math::


    \vec{r}(\vec{a}; \theta)


.. figure:: _static/cc0/williamesix/rotate-goal.svg
    :align: center
    :alt: rotate-goal
    :figclass: align-center

From high school geometry, remember that we can describe a
Cartesian (x,y) point by it's length r, and it's cosine and sine
of it's angle theta.

.. figure:: _static/cc0/williamesix/rotate1.svg
    :align: center
    :alt: rotate1
    :figclass: align-center




Also remember that when calculating sine and cosine, because right
triangles are proportional, that sine and cosine are preserved
for a right triangle, even if the length sides are scaled up or down.

So we'll make a right triangle on the unit circle, but we will remember
the length of (x,y), which we'll call "r", and we'll call the angle
of (x,y) to be "beta".  As a reminder, we want to rotate by a different
angle, called "theta".


.. figure:: _static/cc0/williamesix/rotate2.svg
    :align: center
    :alt: rotate2
    :figclass: align-center


Before we can rotate by "theta", first we need to be able to rotate by
90 degrees, or pi/2.  So to rotate (cos(beta), sin(beta)) by pi/2,
we get (cos(beta+pi/2), sin(beta+pi/2)).



.. figure:: _static/cc0/williamesix/rotate3.svg
    :align: center
    :alt: rotate3
    :figclass: align-center

Now let's give each of those vertices new names, x' and y', for the
purpose of ignoring details for now that we'll return to later,
just let we did for length "r" above.

.. figure:: _static/cc0/williamesix/rotate4.svg
    :align: center
    :alt: rotate4
    :figclass: align-center



Now forget about "beta", and remember that our goal is to rotate by angle
"theta".  Look at the picture below, while turning your head slightly to the
left.  x' and y' look just like our normal Cartesian plane and unit circle,
combined with the "theta"; it looks like what we already know from high
school geometry.

.. figure:: _static/cc0/williamesix/rotate5.svg
    :align: center
    :alt: rotate5
    :figclass: align-center

So with this new frame of reference, we can rotate x' by "theta",
and draw a right triangle on the unit circle using this new
frame of reference.


.. figure:: _static/cc0/williamesix/rotate6.svg
    :align: center
    :alt: rotate6
    :figclass: align-center

So the rotated point can be constructed by the following

.. math::


    \vec{r}(\vec{a}; theta) =  cos(\theta)*\vec{x'} + sin(\theta)*\vec{y'}


.. figure:: _static/cc0/williamesix/rotate7.svg
    :align: center
    :alt: rotate7
    :figclass: align-center

Now that we've found the direction on the unit circle, we remember to make
it length "r".

.. figure:: _static/cc0/williamesix/rotate8.svg
    :align: center
    :alt: rotate8
    :figclass: align-center

Ok, we are now going to stop thinking about geometry, and we will only be thinking
about algebra.  Please don't try to look at the formula and try to draw any diagrams.


Ok, now it's time to remember what the values that x' and y' are defined as.

.. math::


    \vec{r}(\vec{a}; \theta) & = r*(cos(\theta)*\vec{x'} + sin(\theta)*\vec{y'}) \\
                                 & = r*(cos(\theta)*\begin{bmatrix}
                                                       cos(\beta) \\
                                                       sin(\beta) \\
                                                    \end{bmatrix} + sin(\theta)*\begin{bmatrix}
                                                       cos(\beta + \pi/2) \\
                                                       sin(\beta + \pi/2) \\
                                                    \end{bmatrix})

A problem we have now is how to calculate cosine and sine of beta + pi/2,
because we haven't actually calculated beta; we've calculated sine
and cosine of beta by dividing the x value by the magnitude of the a, and the sine of beta
by dividing the y value by the magnitude of a.

.. math::

      cos(\theta) = \vec{a}_{x} / r

      sine(\theta) = \vec{a}_{y} / r

We could try to take the inverse sine or inverse cosine of theta, but there is no need
given properties of trigonometry.

.. math::

      cos(\theta + \pi/2) = -sin(\theta)

      sin(\theta + \pi/2) = cos(\theta)

Therefore

.. math::

      cos(\theta) = \vec{a}_{x} / r

      sin(\theta) = \vec{a}_{y} / r

.. math::

   \vec{r}(\vec{a}; \theta) & = r*(cos(\theta)*\vec{x'} + sin(\theta)*\vec{y'}) \\
                                 & = r*(cos(\theta)*\begin{bmatrix}
                                                       cos(\beta) \\
                                                       sin(\beta) \\
                                                    \end{bmatrix} + sin(\theta)*\begin{bmatrix}
                                                       cos(\beta + \pi/2) \\
                                                       sin(\beta + \pi/2) \\
                                                    \end{bmatrix}) \\
                                 & = r*(cos(\theta)*\begin{bmatrix}
                                                       \vec{a}_{x} / r \\
