Lambda Stack - Demo 18
======================

Purpose
^^^^^^^


Remove repetition in the coordinate transformations,
as previous demos had very similar transformations,
especially from camera space to NDC space.
Each edge of the graph of objects
should only be specified once per frame.

    Full Cayley graph.

Noticing in the previous demos that the lower parts of the transformations
have a common pattern, we can create a stack of functions for later application.
Before drawing geometry, we add any functions to the top of the stack,
apply all of our functions in the stack to our model-space data to
get NDC data,
and before we return to the parent
node, we pop the functions we added off of the stack, to ensure that
we return the stack to the state that the parent node gave us.


To explain in more detail ---

What's the difference between drawing paddle 1 and the square?

Here is paddle 1 code

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/demo17/demo.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: doc-region-begin draw paddle 1
   :end-before: doc-region-end draw paddle 1
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:
   :caption: src/demo17/demo.py



Here is the square's code:


.. literalinclude:: ../../src/demo17/demo.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: doc-region-begin draw square
   :end-before: doc-region-end draw square
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:
   :caption: src/demo17/demo.py





The only difference is the square's model-space to paddle1 space.  Everything else is exactly the same.
In a graphics program, because the scene is a hierarchy of relative
objects, it is unwise to put this much repetition in the transformation
sequence.  Especially if we might change how the camera operates,
or from perspective to ortho.  It would required a lot of code changes.
And I don't like reading from the bottom of the code up.  Code doesn't
execute that way.  I want to read from top to bottom.

When reading the transformation sequences in the previous demos from top down
the transformation at the top is applied first, the transformation
at the bottom is applied last, with the intermediate results method-chained together.
(look up above for a reminder)


With a function stack, the function at the top of the stack (f5) is applied first,
the result of this is then given as input to f4 (second on the stack), all
the way down to f1, which was the first fn to be placed on the stack,
and as such, the last to be applied. (Last In First Applied - LIFA)

               -------------------------
               |
               |  |-------------------|
               |  |                   |
                ->|       f1          |-->  (x,y,z) NDC
                  |-------------------|



So, in order to ensure that the functions in a stack will execute
in the same order as all of the previous demos, they need to be
pushed onto the stack in reverse order.


This means that from model space to world space, we can now
read the transformations FROM TOP TO BOTTOM!!!!  SUCCESS!

Then, to draw the square relative to paddle one, those six
transformations will already be on the stack, therefore
only push the differences, and then apply the stack to
the paddle's model space data.


How to Execute

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

Function stack.  Internally it has a list, where index 0 is
the bottom of the stack.  In python we can store any object
as a variable, and we will be storing functions which transform
a vertex to another vertex, through the "modelspace_to_ndc" method.

In previous demos, camera_space_to_ndc_space_fn was always
the last function called in the method chained pipeline.  Put it on the bottom of the stack,
by pushing it first,
so that "modelspace_to_ndc" calls this function last.  Each subsequent push will add
a new function to the top of the stack.


.. math::


    \vec{f}_{c}^{ndc}

.. figure:: _static/demo18-2.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Demo 12
    :figclass: align-center



.. literalinclude:: ../../src/demo18/demo.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: doc-region-begin stack push camera space to ndc
   :end-before: doc-region-end stack push camera space to ndc
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:
   :caption: src/demo18/demo.py



Unlike in previous demos in which we read the transformations
from model space to world space backwards; this time because the transformations
are on a stack, the fns on the model stack can
be read forwards, where each operation translates/rotates/scales
the current space

The camera's position and orientation are defined relative
to world space like so, read top to bottom:

.. math::


    \vec{f}_{c}^{w}

.. figure:: _static/demo18-3.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Demo 12
    :figclass: align-center


.. literalinclude:: ../../src/demo18/demo.py

   :end-before: doc-region-end camera space to world space, commented out
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:
   :caption: src/demo18/demo.py


But, since we need to transform world-space to camera space,
they must be inverted by reversing the order, and negating
the arguments

Therefore the transformations to put the world space into
camera space are.

.. math::


    \vec{f}_{w}^{c}

draw paddle 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unlike in previous demos in which we read the transformations
from model space to world space backwards; because the transformations
are on a stack, the fns on the model stack can
be read forwards, where each operation translates/rotates/scales
the current space

.. math::


    \vec{f}_{p1}^{w}

   :lineno-match:

for each of the modelspace coordinates, apply all
of the procedures on the stack from top to bottom
this results in coordinate data in NDC space,
which we can pass to glVertex3f


.. literalinclude:: ../../src/demo18/demo.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: doc-region-begin draw paddle 1
   :end-before: doc-region-end draw paddle 1
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:

draw the square
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

since the modelstack is already in paddle1's space,
and since the blue square is defined relative to paddle1,
just add the transformations relative to it
before the blue square is drawn.  Draw the square, and then
remove these 4 transformations from the stack (done below)

.. math::


    \vec{f}_{s}^{p1}

.. figure:: _static/demo18-5.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Demo 12

   :lineno-match:

Now we need to remove fns from the stack so that the
lambda stack will convert from world space to NDC.
This will allow us to just add the transformations from
world space to paddle2 space on the stack.

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/demo18/demo.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: doc-region-begin pop to get back to world space
   :end-before: doc-region-end pop to get back to world space
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:
   :caption: src/demo18/demo.py


since paddle2's model_space is independent of paddle 1's space, only
leave the view and projection fns (1) - (4)


draw paddle 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. math::


    \vec{f}_{p2}^{w}

.. figure:: _static/demo18-6.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Demo 12
    :figclass: align-center


.. literalinclude:: ../../src/demo18/demo.py

   :end-before: doc-region-end draw paddle 2
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:
   :caption: src/demo18/demo.py



remove all fns from the function stack, as the next frame will set them
clear makes the list empty, as the list (stack) will be repopulated
the next iteration of the event loop.

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/demo18/demo.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: doc-region-begin clear function stack for next iteration of the event loop
   :end-before: doc-region-end clear function stack for next iteration of the event loop
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:
   :caption: src/demo18/demo.py



Swap buffers and execute another iteration of the event loop

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/demo18/demo.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: doc-region-begin flush framebuffer
   :end-before: doc-region-end flush framebuffer
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:
   :caption: src/demo18/demo.py

Notice in the above code, adding functions to the stack is creating a shared
context for transformations, and before we call "glVertex3f", we always call
"modelspace_to_ndc" on the modelspace vertex.  In Demo 19, we will be using
OpenGL 2.1 matrix stacks.  Although we don't have the code for the OpenGL
driver, given that you'll see that we pass modelspace data directly to "glVertex3f",
it should be clear that the OpenGL implementation must fetch the modelspace
to NDC transformations from the ModelView and Projection matrix stacks.
