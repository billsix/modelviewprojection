Adding Depth - Z axis Demo 14
=============================

Purpose
^^^^^^^
Do the same stuff as the previous demo, but use 3D coordinates,
where the negative z axis goes into the screen (because
of the right hand rule).  Positive z comes out of the monitor
towards your face.


Things that this demo doesn't end up doing correctly:

* The blue square is always drawn, even
  when its z-coordinate in world space is less than the paddle's.  The solution will be
  z-buffering https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-buffering,
  and it is implemented in the next demo.

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^


..
   TODO -- see if this text can fit.
   Other things added
   Added rotations around the x axis, y axis, and z axis.
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix

   Added translate in 3D.  Added scale in 3D.  These are just like
   the 2D versions, just with the same process applied to the z axis.

   They direction of the rotation is defined by the right hand rule.



* Vertex data will now have an X, Y, and Z component.
* Rotations around an angle in 3D space follow the right hand rule_.  Here's a link to them
  in matrix_ form, which we have not yet covered.

* With open palm, fingers on the x axis, rotating the fingers to y axis,
  means that the positive z axis is in the direction of the thumb.  Positive Theta
  moves in the direction that your fingers did.
* starting on the y axis, rotating to z axis, thumb is on the positive x axis.
* starting on the z axis, rotating to x axis, thumb is on the positive y axis.

Rotate Z
~~~~~~~~


Rotate Z is the same rotate that we've used so far, but doesn't affect
the z component at all.

Code
^^^^

The only new aspect of the code below is that the paddles have
a z-coordinate of 0 in their modelspace.

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/demo14.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: doc-region-begin instantiate paddle 1
   :end-before: doc-region-end instantiate paddle 1
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:
   :caption: src/demo14.py


The only new aspect of the square below is that the paddles have
a z-coordinate of 0 in their modelspace.  N.B that since we
do a sequence transformations to the modelspace data to get
to world-space coordinates, the X, Y, and Z coordinates
are subject to be different.


.. literalinclude:: ../../src/demo14.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: doc-region-begin define camera class
   :end-before: doc-region-end define camera class
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:
   :caption: src/demo14.py

The camera now has a z-coordinate of 0 also.


.. literalinclude:: ../../src/demo14.py
   :language: python

* Draw Paddle 1

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/demo14.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: doc-region-begin draw paddle 1
   :end-before: doc-region-end draw paddle 1
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:
   :caption: src/demo14.py


The square should not be visible when hidden behind the paddle1,
as we do a translate by -1.  But in running the demo, you see
that the square is always drawn over the paddle.


* Draw the Square

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/demo14.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: doc-region-begin draw square
   :end-before: doc-region-end draw square
   :linenos:
   :lineno-match:
   :caption: src/demo14.py



This is because without depth_ buffering, the object drawn last
clobbers the color of any previously drawn object at the pixel.
Try moving the square drawing code to the beginning, and you will
see that the square can be hidden behind the paddle.

* Draw Paddle 2

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/demo14.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: doc-region-begin draw paddle 2
   :end-before: doc-region-end draw paddle 2
