Rotation Fix Attempt 1 - Demo 08
================================

Purpose
^^^^^^^

Fix the rotation problem from the previous demo in a seemingly intuitive
way, but do it inelegantly.

    Demo 08




How to Execute
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Linux or on MacOS, in a shell, type "python src/demo08/demo.py".
On Windows, in a command prompt, type "python src\\demo08\\demo.py".


Move the Paddles using the Keyboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

==============  ================================
Keyboard Input  Action

==============  ================================

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

The problem in the last demo is that all rotations happen relative
to World Space's (0,0) and axes.  By translating our paddles to their position
before rotating, they are rotated around World Space's origin, instead
of being rotated around their modelspace's center.


In this demo, we try to solve the problem by making a method to rotate
around a given point in world space, in this case, the paddle's center.

Within the event loop, this seems quite reasonable

All we did was add a rotate around method, and call it, with the
paddle's center as the rotate point.

    Works but sloppy


Although this works for now and looks like decent code, this is extremely sloppy, and
not thought out well at all.  We apply a transformation
from paddle space to world space, then do the inverse, then rotate,
and then do the first transformation from paddle space to world space again.

The images of the transformation sequence below should show how brain-dead it is,
and the Cayley graph is gross.

But from this we will learn something important.

Cayley Graph
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note, this is gross, and the edge from the paddlespace to itself doesn't even
make any sense, but the author did not know how else to represent
this code.
