   Frame Buffer
     An array of pixel values, where each pixel holds information such as
     color (red, green, blue, alpha), depth (how far a fragment is from
     the camera), and sometimes stencil values (for masking
     operations).

   Normalized Device Coordinates
     Normalized Device Coordinates are the range of values from -1.0 to 1.0
     in the X, Y, and Z directions, the last space before drawing geometry
     in screen space.  Anything vertex outside of the NDC range will not
     be mapped to a pixel.

   World Space
     World space

   Modelspace
     Modelspace

   Screen Space
     Screen space is an index (x,y) that is mapped to a pixel on a monitor.

   Event Loop
     An event loop is a programming construct that continuously waits for and dispatches
     events or messages in a program. At its core, it works like this:

     #. The program has a queue of tasks, events, or messages that need to
        be processed (like user input, network responses, timers, etc.).

     #. The event loop repeatedly checks this queue.  If there’s an event
        waiting, it pulls it from the queue and runs the associated
        code (often a callback or handler).

     #. If the queue is empty, it waits until something new arrives.

     This pattern is common in systems where tasks happen asynchronously—such
     as GUIs or command lines because it lets programs handle many things
     (like clicks, network requests, or timers) without blocking on just one operation.
