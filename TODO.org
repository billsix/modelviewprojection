      - [ ]underscores
    - [ ] Ch 8

      - [ ] Do it by making relative number lines
      - [X] Add in _add_ method to add vertices
      - [X] define translate by add
      - [X] rotate should be implemented using add, to scaled vectors
      - [X] update the images.  I'd rather have hand drawn images, then what is currently there
      - [ ] Update for chapter 18+
    - [X] fix warning of matplotlib
    <2024-01-27 Sat> Got that done a few days ago
    - [X] Change suffix (and emacs mode) of preprocess files so that warnings go away when building docs
    <2024-01-27 Sat> this is a moot point after https://github.com/billsix/modelviewprojection/commit/93daf37105890952ad3d2bc983f1f011927506ce

      - [ ] Connect with 20 - Draw VBO, draw VAO.  Give shader variables names similar to 20
    - [ ] Ch 22
      - [ ] Make 22.  Same as 21, but pass color as uniform
      - [ ] Draw diagram of VBO, programs in parallel, and uniforms, same way matrix is.  Perhaps draw nested blocks to show scope hierarchy
      - [ ] Talk about binding.  Draw diagrams of them as global variables.  Perhaps make sample Python class, implemented as map for binding
