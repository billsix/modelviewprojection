    - [-] Ch 4
      * [-] Introduct vector additon, use math notation
        - [ ] explain thinking about the two forms, coordinate free is easier to visualize and simpler, coordinates for when the work has to get done
        - [ ] explain notation, and how x means two different things, and sub 1 and sub 2 mean something different
      * [ ] put in example values for when the user pressed a/e
        - [ ] say number of times that e has been pressed
    - [ ] Ch 5
      - [ ] Add unit test for translate
      - [ ] Replace inlined example codes with unit test
      - [ ] make translate call ?.
        - [ ] implement add
        - [ ] explain add
      - [ ] line 202 and 211, nofmt and make single line
    - [ ] Ch 6
      - [ ] explain a, b, c, d, with names like from geometry
      - [ ] make tables for whole chapter
      - [ ] add color to tables of numbers
      - [ ] add circle for origin
      - [ ] add colored components mult by (1,0) and (0, 1)
      - [ ] scaling - add tables
      - [ ] remove inline Tex that uses coordinates
      - [ ]define scale with coordinates, define scale * vector, using cheerios as example
      - [ ] define _mul_, _rmul_, and define uniform scale by it
      - [ ] make plot to show -1, -1 for p1 and p2
    - [ ] Ch 7
      - [ ]tables
      - [ ]underscores
    - [ ] Ch 8
      - [ ] tables
      - [ ] "reset the coordinate system", explain natural basis
    - [ ] Ch 10
      - [ ] give shout out to mvpdemo#, and how to run it
    - [ ] Ch 21 Finish the chapter on the perspective projection
    - [ ] Make the content for VAO, VBO, shaders, etc, from my class git repo
    - [X] make function names on Cayley graphs look better using images
    - [71%] Rewrite rotate, and update explanations.
      - [ ] Do it by making relative number lines
      - [ ] Update for chapter 18+
    - [ ] Ch 16
      - [ ] Fix spacing on linu 267 section
    - [ ] Ch 17
      - [ ] Fix two diagrams
      - [ ] Add third diagram
    - [ ] Ch 18
      - [ ] More detail instead of f1, f2, f3
      - [ ] Event loop, put Cayley graph above
      - [ ] Spacing line 436
      - [ ] Put pics of stacks inline with push pop
      - [ ] Explain Callable, make example
    - [ ] Ch 19
      - [ ] Take comments and put them in rst instead of inlined code
    - [ ] Ch 20
      - [ ] Do much better.  Drap diagrams.  Explain better
      - [ ] Don't put commented code in inline code
    - [ ] Ch 21
      - [ ] Do much better
      - [ ] Connect with 20 - Draw VBO, draw VAO.  Give shader variables names similar to 20
    - [ ] Ch 22
      - [ ] Make 22.  Same as 21, but pass color as uniform
      - [ ] Draw diagram of VBO, programs in parallel, and uniforms, same way matrix is.  Perhaps draw nested blocks to show scope hierarchy
      - [ ] Talk about binding.  Draw diagrams of them as global variables.  Perhaps make sample Python class, implemented as map for binding
