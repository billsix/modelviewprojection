Matrix Stacks - Demo 19
=======================

Purpose
^^^^^^^

Replace lambda stacks with matrix stacks.  This is how preshader
opengl worked (well, they provided matrix operations, but I replaced
them with my own to make the matrix operations transparent).

The concepts behind the function stack, in which the first function
added to the stack is the last function applied, hold true for
matricies as well.  But matricies are a much more efficient
representation computationally than the function stack,
and instead of adding fns and later having to remove them,
we can save onto the current frame of reference with a "glPushStack",
and restore the saved state by "glPopStack"

Use glPushMatrix and glPopMatrix to save/restore a local coordinate
system, that way a tree of objects can be drawn without one child
destroying the relative coordinate system of the parent node.

In mvpVisualization/3/demo3.py, the grayed out
coordinate system is one thas has been pushed onto the stack,
and it regains it's color when it is reactivated by "glPopMatrix"




How to Execute
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Linux or on MacOS, in a shell, type "python src/demo20/demo.py".
On Windows, in a command prompt, type "python src\\demo20\\demo.py".

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^



First thing to note is that we are now using OpenGL's official transformation
procedures, and in the perspective transformation, they flip the z axis, making
it a left hand coordinate system.  The reason for this is discussed in the next
chapter.  But for now, it means that we have to change how the depth test
will be configured.

The clear depth that is set for each fragment each frame is now 1.0,
and the test for a given fragment to overwrite the color in the color
buffer is changed to be less than or equal to.

The Event Loop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Set the model, view, and projection matrix to the identity
matrix.  This just means that the functions (currently)
will not transform data.
In univariate terms, f(x) = x

.. literalinclude:: ../src/demo19/demo.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 222
   :lines: 222-226


change the perspective matrix to convert the frustum
to clip space
set the projection matrix to be perspective.  Since
the viewport is always square, set the aspect ratio to be 1.0.
We are now going to clip space instead of to NDC, which we be discussed
in the next chapter.

.. figure:: _static/perspective.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Demo 11
    :figclass: align-center

    Turn our NDC into Clip Space


.. literalinclude:: ../src/demo19/demo.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 230
   :lines: 230-235


The camera's position is described as follows

::

    #glTranslate(camera.x, camera.y, camera.z)
    #glRotatef(math.degrees(camera.rot_y), 0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
    #glRotatef(math.degrees(camera.rot_x), 1.0, 0.0, 0.0)


Therefore, to take the object's world space coordinates
and transform them into camera space, we need to
do the inverse operations to the view stack.


.. literalinclude:: ../src/demo19/demo.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 245
   :lines: 245-247



Each call above actually modifies the matrix, as matricies
can be premultiplied together for efficiency.

::

 |a b|     |e f|         |ae+bg  af+bh|
 |c d|  *  |g h|  =      |ce+dg  cf+dh|

This means that rotate_x, rotate_y, translate, etc
are destructive operations.  Instead of creating a stack
of matricies, these operations aggregate the transformations,
but add no new matricies to the stack

But many times we need to hold onto a transformation stack (matrix),
so that we can do something else now, and return to this context later,
so we have a stack composed of matricies.

This is what glPushMatrix, and glPopMatrix do.

"PushMatrix" describes what the function does, but its purpose is to
save onto the current coordinate system for later drawing modelspace
data.

The model stack is currently the identity matrix, meaning
it does nothing.  The view and the projection matrix
are set to transform from world space into camera space,
and then take the frustum and convert it to NDC.

Save onto the current model stack, so that paddle 2 can be drawn relative
to it.

   :language: python

draw paddle 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unlike in previous demos, because the transformations
are on a stack, the fns on the model stack can
be read forwards, where each operation translates/rotates/scales
the current space

glVertex data is specified in modelspace coordinates,
but since we loaded the projection matrix and the modelview
matrix into OpenGL, glVertex3f will apply those transformations for us!

.. literalinclude:: ../src/demo19/demo.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 261
   :lines: 261-273







draw the square relative to paddle 1
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

Since the modelstack is already in paddle1's space
just add the transformations relative to it
before paddle 2 is drawn, we need to remove
the square's 3 model_space transformations

.. literalinclude:: ../src/demo19/demo.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 277
   :lines: 277-298

No need to push matrix here, as this is the last object that
we are drawing, and upon the next iteration of the event loop,
all 3 matricies will be reset to the identity

draw paddle 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
