Window Resizing and Proportionality - Demo 03
=============================================

Problem With Previous Demo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run Demo 2 again, but resize the window; first make it skinny,
and then wide.  Look at what happens to the rectangles.

    Demo 03

Purpose
^^^^^^^

Modify the previous demo, so that if the user resizes the window
of the OpenGL program, that the picture does not become distorted.


Keeping the Paddles Proportional
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create procedure to ensure proportionality

In the previous demo, if the user resized the window, the paddles looked bad,
as they were shrunk in one direction if the window became too thin or too fat.

.. figure:: _static/disproportionate1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Yuck
    :figclass: align-center

    Yuck

.. figure:: _static/disproportionate2.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Yuck
    :figclass: align-center

    Yuck


Assume that this is a problem for the application we are making.  What
would a solution be?  Ideally, we would like to draw our paddles with
a black background within a square region in the center of the window, regardless of the dimensions
of the window.

OpenGL has a solution for us.  The *viewport* is a rectangular region
within the window into which OpenGL will render.  The normalized-device-coordinates
will therefore resolve to the sub-window space of the viewport, instead of the whole
window.


.. figure:: _static/viewport.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Nice
    :figclass: align-center

    Nice

Because we will only draw in a subset of the window, and because all subsequent
chapters will use this functionality, I have created a procedure for use
in all chapters. "draw_in_square_viewport" is a function.


Code
^^^^

GLFW/OpenGL Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The setup code is the same.  Initialize GLFW.  Set the OpenGL version.
Create the window.  Set a key handler for closing.
Execute the event/drawing loop.

* the scissor test allows us to specify a region
  of the framebuffer into which the opengl operations
  will apply.  In this case, in the framebuffer is all gray.
  by calling glScissor, we are setting a value on a square
  of pixels which says "only do the opengl call on these".
  As we will learn later, OpenGL stores much more information
  per pixel than just it's current color.

* disable the scissor test, so now any opengl calls will
  happen as usual.

But, we only want to draw within the black square.
We set the viewport, so that the NDC coordinates
will be mapped the the region of screen coordinates
that we care about, which is the black square.

The Event Loop
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

The event loop is just like the previous demo,
but this time we call the procedure to
ensure that we only draw in a square subset of
the window.
