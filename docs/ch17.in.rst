3D Perspective - Demo 17
========================

Purpose
^^^^^^^

Implement a perspective projection so that objects
further away are smaller than the would be
if they were close by

                              (x,0)


If we draw a straight line between (x,z) and (0,0), we will have a right triangle
with vertices (0,0), (0,z), and (x,z).

There also will be a similar right triangle with verticies (0,0), (0,nearZ), and
whatever point the line above intersects the line at z=nearZ.  Let's call that point
(projX, nearZ)

::

        because right angle and tan(theta) = tan(theta)
        x / z = projX / nearZ
        projX = x / z * nearZ

        So use projX as the transformed x value, and keep the distance z.

                               ----------- far z

                               |          |
                (x / z * nearZ,z) *       |   non-linear -- the transformation of x depends on its z value
