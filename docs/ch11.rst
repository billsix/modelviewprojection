Relative Objects - Demo 11
==========================

Purpose
^^^^^^^

Introduce relative objects, by making a small blue square
that is defined relative to the left paddle, but offset
some in the x direction.
When the paddle on the left moves or rotates, the blue square
moves with it, because it is defined relative to it.

Things to note.

#. When dealing with any object space to world space,
I recommend reading the order of transformations backwards,
imagining a moving origin, x and y axis.

#. Reading the code from world space to camera space requires
a different interpretation.  You can think of the camera
as being defined relative to world space, and you can develop
a mental model of the transformations in the same manner that
you would do for any object.  But, because NDC is going to
be defined relative to camera space, the transformations
that you need to apply to an object (paddle1, square 1, etc)
are the inverse of what you would do to the "camera".

#. We in looking at the code for the three objects we are drawing
you might notice that we are duplicating a lot of code, and
that if we decide to change paddle1's transformations, that
we would need to change the code in multiple places.
Later demos will show how to handle this problem more gracefully.
