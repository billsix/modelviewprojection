On Windows, in a command prompt, type "python src\\demo04\\demo.py".


Move the Paddles using the Keyboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

==============  ======================
Keyboard Input  Action
==============  ======================
*w*             Move Left Paddle Up
*s*             Move Left Paddle Down
*k*             Move Right Paddle Down
*i*             Move Right Paddle Up
==============  ======================


Paddles which don't move are quite boring.  Let's make them move up or down
by getting keyboard input.

And while we are at it, let's go ahead and create data structures for a Vertex,
and for the collection of verticies that make up a Paddle.

Code
^^^^


Data Structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here we use dataclasses_, which automatically creates on
the class a
constructor, accessor methods, and pretty-printer.  This saves
a lot of boiler plate code.

.. _dataclasses: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRVVyl9uaZc


.. LINENOS ../src/demo04/demo.py defvertexclass

.. LINENOS ../src/demo04/demo.py defpaddleclass

Although Python is a dynamically-typed language, we can add type information as helpful hints to the reader,
and for use with static type-checking tools for Python, such as `mypy`_.

.. _mypy: http://mypy-lang.org/


.. LINENOS ../src/demo04/demo.py defpaddles

* Create two instances of a Paddle.

I make heavy use of `keyword arguments`_ in Python.

.. _keyword arguments: https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-keyword-arguments/

Notice that I am nesting the constructors.  I could have instead have written the
construction of paddle1 like this:


.. code-block:: python

       x = -1.0
       y = -0.3
       vertex_one = Vertex(x, y)
       x = -0.8
       y = -0.3
       vertex_two = Vertex(x, y)
       x = -0.8
       y = 0.3
       vertex_three = Vertex(x, y)
       x = -1.0
       y = 0.3
       vertex_four = Vertex(x, y)
       vertex_list = list(vertex_one, vertex_two, vertex_three, vertex_four)
       r = 0.57
       g = 0.0
       b = 1.0
       paddle1 = Paddle(vertex_list, r, g, b)

But then I would have many local variables, some of whose values
change frequently over time, and most of which are single use variables.
By nesting the constructors as the author has done above, the author
minimizes those issues at the expense of requiring a degree on non-linear
reading of the code, which gets easy with practice.


Query User Input and Use It To Animate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. LINENOS ../src/demo04/demo.py fnhandle


- If the user presses 's' this frame, subtract 0.1 from the y component of each of
  the vertices in the paddle. If the
  key continues to be held down over time, this value will continue to decrease.
- If the user presses  'w' this frame, add 0.1 more to the y component of each of
  the vertices in the paddle
- If the user presses  'k' this frame, subtract 0.1.
- If the user presses 'i' this frame, add 0.1 more.



* when writing to global variables within a nested scope,
  you need to declare their scope as global at the top of the nested scope.
  (techincally it's not a global variable, it's local to the current python
  module, but the point remains)




The Event Loop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Monitors can have variable framerates, and in order to ensure
that movement is consistent across different monitors, we choose
to only flush the screen at 60 hertz (frames per second).


.. LINENOS ../src/demo04/demo.py framerate

.. LINENOS ../src/demo04/demo.py eventloop

.. LINENOS ../src/demo04/demo.py startframe

.. LINENOS ../src/demo04/demo.py square

.. LINENOS ../src/demo04/demo.py movement

* We're still near the beginning of the event loop, and we
  haven't drawn the paddles yet.  So we call the function
  to query the user input, which will also modify the vertices'
  values if there was input.

.. LINENOS ../src/demo04/demo.py paddle1



* on line 179, while rendering, we now loop over the verticies of the paddle.
  The paddles may be displaced from their original position that was hardcoded,
  as the callback may have updated the values based off of the user input.

* When glVertex is now called, we are not directly
  passing numbers into it, but instead we are getting
  the numbers from the data structures of Paddle and its
  associated vertcies.
