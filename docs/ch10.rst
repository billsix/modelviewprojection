Camera Space - Demo 10
======================

Purpose
^^^^^^^

Graphical programs in which the viewer never "moves" are boring.
Model a virtual "camera", and let the user move the camera around
in the scene.  In this picture, notice that the purple paddle
is no longer on the left side of the screen, but towards the right,
horizontally.

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

"Camera space" means the coordinates of everything relative
to a camera, not relative to world space.

    Camera is 3D space

In the picture above, using 3D space, NDC is the cube in the center
of the screen, and its coordinate system is defined by the three gray vectiors.
The cube to the left is the position of the camera; its local X coordinate
is the red arrow, its local Y coordinate is the green arrow, its local
Z coordinate is the blue arrow.  We will get to 3D later,
but the point is that the coordinates of the paddle can be described
in world space, or in camera space, and that we can create functions
to convert coordinates between the two spaces.



Towards that, in the Cayley graph, camera space will be between world space and NDC, but
which way should the direction of the edge be?

It could be

* From world space to camera space.

    Demo 10


Since the camera's position will be described relative to world space in world space coordinates,
just like the paddles are,
it makes more sense to use the latter, in which the directed edge
goes from camera space to world space.


Think about it this way.  Imagine you a driving.  Are you staying
in a constant position, and the wheels of your car rotate the entire
earth and solar system around yourself?  That's one way to look at
it, and the earth revolves around me too, but the mathematical
descriptions of everything else that's not you breaks down.

The math is easier in the aggregate if you describe your position as moving relative
to earth.

But this introduces a new problem.  Follow from the paddle's modelspace
to screen space.  Up until this demo, we've always been
following the the direction of each edges.  In our new Cayley graph, when going from world
space to camera space, we're moving in the opposite direction
of the edge.

Going against the direction
of an edge in a Cayley Graph means that we don't apply the function itself;
instead we apply the inverse of the function.  This concept
comes from Group Theory in Abstract Algebra, the details of which won't
be discussed here, but we will use it to help us reason about the transformations.

Inverses
~~~~~~~~

Inverse Of Translate
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

The inverse of

.. code:: Python

      >>> v.translate(x,y)

is

.. code:: Python

      >>> v.translate(-x,-y)

Inverse Of Rotate
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&



The inverse of

.. code:: Python

      >>> v.rotate(theta)

is

.. code:: Python

      >>> v.rotate(-theta)

Inverse Of Scale
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

The inverse of

.. code:: Python

      >>> v.scale(x,y)

is

.. code:: Python

      >>> v.scale(1.0/x,1.0/y)


Inverse Of Sequence Of Functions
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

The inverse of a sequence of functions is the inverse of each function, applied in reverse order.

For the linear-algebra inclined reader,

.. math::
    \begin{equation}
    {(A * B)}^{-1}     = {B}^{-1}*{A}^{-1}
     \end{equation}

The inverse of

.. code:: Python

      >>> v.scale(x,y).translate(tx,tx)

is

.. code:: Python

      >>> v.translate(-tx,-tx).scale(1.0/x,1.0/y)





Think of the inverses this way.  Stand up.  Make sure that nothing
is close around you that you could trip on or that you would walk into.
Look forward.
Keeping your eyes straight ahead, sidestep a few steps to the
left.  From your perspective, the objects in your room all moved
to the right.  Now, rotate your head to your right, keeping your eyes
looking directly in front of your head.  Which way did the room move?
Towards the left.


Back to camera space.  Unfortunately, the author doesn't have visualizations for this in 2D space.

    Camera is 3D space

Looking at the graph paper on the ground there, that's world space.
The camera gets placed in world space just like any other modelspace data.
In order to render from the camera's point of view, we need to move and orient the -1.0 to 1.0
box relative to the camera to match the -1.0 to 1.0 box in world space.

Run "python mvpVisualization/4/demo4.py", and follow along with the Cayley
graph.  The camera will be placed like any other modelspace data, but then
the inverse of the transformations will be applied to all of the verticies.

For the attentive reader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The purpose of watching that animation was to see how the camera was placed just like
the modelspace data was placed, while not modifying the modelspace data,
but then the inverse was applied, moving the modelspace data.

The attentive reader may notice: "Bill, you said the the inverse causes the operations
to be run in opposite order, yet I saw them run in the same order.  For camera
placement, I saw translate,
then rotate sideways, then rotate up.  For the inverse, I saw inverse translate, then
inverse rotate sideways, then inverse rotate up.  What gives?"

Well, the answer, which we talk about later in more detail, is that we change the
order in which we read the sequence of transformations.

Let's say we read the following from left to right

.. math::
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    \vec{f}  & = \vec{a} \circ \vec{b} \circ \vec{c}
    \end{split}
    \end{equation}

So we imagine the a transformation, then the b transformation, then the c.

To take the inverse, we reverse the order of the transformations, and invert them.

.. math::
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    \vec{f}^{-1}  & = \vec{c}^{-1} \circ \vec{b}^{-1} \circ \vec{a}^{-1}
    \end{split}
    \end{equation}

But now we read the transformations from right to left.

So we imagine the a inverse transformation, then the b inverse
transformation, then the c inverse.

The author understands that this may be confusing to the reader, and
seems illogical.  Camera placement is, in the author's opinion,
the most difficult concept for a novice to grasp, and the author
is unaware of a better explanation.  Bear with the author, by the end of this book,
it should make more sense to the reader.

The camera's position is at camera.x, camera.y.  So
apply the inverse of the camera's transformations
to paddle 1's vertices, i.e. translate with the negative
values.
