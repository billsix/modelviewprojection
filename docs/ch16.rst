Moving Camera in 3D Space - Demo 16
===================================

Purpose
^^^^^^^

Make a moving camera in 3D space.  Use Ortho to put a rectangular prism
into NDC.

Problem purposefully put in

When moving front to back, parts of the geometry disappears.
This is because it gets "clipped out", as the geometry is outside
of NDC, (-1 to 1 on all three axis).  We could fix this by making
a bigger ortho rectangular prism, but because of problem 3, we'll
ignore that for now.

This doesn't look like a 3D application should, where further away
objects are smaller.  This will be fixed in demo17

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

NEW CAMERA CONTROLS for up, left, down, right, page up, page down
Camera now moves through the 3D world, as you would expect to see
in any first person game, but very poorly as perspective is not
taken into account.  (Perspective meaning that objects that are
further away down the negative z axis appear smaller in terms
of their x and y coordinate)

The camera has an x,y,z position, and two rotations (one around
the x axis, and one around the y axis).

NOTE - the camera space transformtions are the most unintuitive aspects
of graphics programming.  If you read the transformations
here from top down, you are envisioning moving all of the objects
in the scene, and that your camera is fixed, the diagram
on the left side of the following image.

eog ../images/demo10.png

That is the equivalent of when driving, that your car is fixed,
and that you are rotating the earth.  This way of thinking,
may suffice to you, and if you can keep it straight, great.
The camera isn't moving, everything else has a velocity
that's in the opposite direction.

If instead, you view that the camera is defined in terms of world
space, and it's movement is relative to that world space, (the right
diagram in demo10.png), then the intepretation is a bit harder.
First, think of the transformations that put your camera in the
correct position and orientation.  Write them down.

#. translate to the camera's position, using the actual position values
   of camera position (not their negatives)
#. rotate around the y axis
#. rotate around the x axis

The ordering of 1) before 2) and 3) should be clear, as
we are imagining a coordinate system that moves, just
like we do for the modelspace to world space transformations.
The ordering of 2) and 3) is very important, and 2 rotations
across different axises are not commutative.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property.


(Remember, read bottom up, just like the previous demos
for modelspace to worldspace data)

::

        world_space = camera_space.rotate_x(camera.rot_x)
                                  .rotate_y(camera.rot_y)
                                  .translate(tx=camera.x,
                                             ty=camera.y,
                                             tz=camera.z)


We rotate on the y axis first, then the x axis. (described later)

Try this.  Rotate your head to the right a little more that
45 degrees.  Now rotate your head back a little more than 45 degrees.

Now, reset your head (glPopMatrix). Try rotating your head back 45 degrees.  Once it's there,
rotate your head (not your neck), 45 degrees.  It's different, and uncomfortable!

We rotate the camera by the y axis first, then by the relative x axis,
for the same reason.


Back to the point, we are envisioning the camera relative to the world
space by making a moving coordinate system (composed of an origin, 1 unit
in the "x" axis, 1 unit in the "y" axis, and 1 unit in the axis), where
each subsequent transformation is relative to the previous coordinate system.
(This system is beneficial btw because it allows us to think of one coordinate
system at a time, and forget how we got there, (similar to a Markov process,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain))

But that system of thinking works only when we are placing the camera into
it's position/orientation.  Looking at the right hand picture of
eog ../images/demo10.png
thinking in this way would allow us to transform vertices defined in camera space
to world space, just like the paddles/square.

But we don't want that.  Instead, we want to take the modelspace geometry from,
say Paddle1 space, to world space,
and then to camera space (which is going in the opposite direction, therefore requires
an inverse operation, just like in the univariate currency example from Bitcoin to Euro.

eog ../images/currency.png

Given that the inverse of a sequence of transformations is the sequence backwards,
with each transformations inverted, we must do that to get from world space
to camera space.

If I tell you to take two steps to the left, rotate 90 degrees, and then reverse it,
you'd rotate 90 degress in the opposite direction, and then take two steps to the right.

(See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication, under
 the section on square matricies, which say that (A*B)^-1 = (B^-1) * (A^-1) )

The inverted form is

::

       camera_space = world_space.translate(tx=-camera.x,
                                            ty=-camera.y,
                                            tz=-camera.z)
                                 .rotate_y( -camera.rot_y)
                                 .rotate_x( -camera.rot_x)

Trying to reason about the camera's position and orientation is difficult.
As such, in this demo, I have added the non-inverted transformations
in the comments, but will not do so in subsequent demos.



Before we start, take a look at ../mvpVisualization/demo.py
to see the 3D geometry drawn both in world space and in their modelspace.

To count in the modelspace, look at a given axis (which I've drawn in units
of 10 for ease of viewing, although it should normally be in units of 1)
On the red axis, it's 2*10 units wide, and 6*10 units tall, which matches
the modelspace data in the constructor for the Paddles.

Take a look at ../mvpVisualization/demoAnimation.py to see an animated
version of the axis being moved from into their world space positions,
relative to which the modelspace data is drawn.

The gray axis in the middle happens when we hold onto the original
axises, as we first draw paddle 1 relative to it, the square relative
to paddle1, but we need to later get back to world space so that we
can draw paddle2.  In later code, we will use glPushMatrix to
save onto a copy of the current axises, and glPopMatrix to discard
our "current at the time" axis, returning back to the saved axis.  Like a quicksave
in a video game.

To follow along with the code, read the transformations from modelspace
to worldspace backwards, and you will see how the axises are moving and
why.

Take a look at ../mvpVisualization/demoViewWorldTopLevel.py to see an
animated version that shows the objects being placed in world space,
the camera being put into it's space using the normal way of thinking
of a coordinate system being moved, but then the transformations
are inverted, brining the objects in world space with it,
in backwards order, to put the NDC cube defined in camera
space to the NDC defined in world space.  One way to think of it,
is that NDC is defined at the top level of the tree of transformations,
so in world space.  We need to get the -1 to 1 space in x,y,z relative
to camera space to match the -1 to 1 space in world space.

eog ../images/demo10.png

Why do we do this?  Because it doesn't matter how we think about
the coordinate transformations, the computer will always execute
the code from top down, take the resulting coordinates, and clip
out anything outside of -1 to 1. So, world space. The computer has no notion
of camera space, it's our own invention, so we need to get the coordinates
that we care about into that space.

After looking at the demos and explaining the code, now cover the camera movement code.

Other things added
Added rotations around the x axis, y axis, and z axis.

the square should not be visible when hidden behind the paddle1,
as we did a translate by -10.
this is because without depth buffering, the object drawn last
clobbers the color of any previously drawn object at the pixel.
Try moving the square drawing code to the beginning, and you will
see that the square can be hidden behind the paddle.


NEW
The input for the camera is completely different
move multiple

TODO -  explaing movement on XZ-plane, on line 230
TODO -  show camera movement in graphviz


pressing right or left changs the rotation of the y axis,
making you look left or right
pressing page up or page down changes how you'll rotate
on the relative x axis to look up or down, after
you've rotated left or right
Don't worry about understanding the movement of the camera in 3D
space for now, this will be explained in demo18.
But, if you want a preview, run ../mvpVisualization/demoViewWorldTopLevel.py,
and look at when the camera translates to it's position, and rotates horizontally.
(before rotating vertically to look up).  The relative negative z axis is where
pressing up will take you, strafing to the right would be in the direction of
the local x axis.
